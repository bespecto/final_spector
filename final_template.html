    				<p class="lead">Eli Manning's career is one that is constantly dissected by football fans. While the quarterback led the New York Giants to two Super Bowl victories, earning MVP honors in both, he had an up-and-down NFL career. Should his two Super Bowl victories, and the fact that his family has a prestigious record in the NFL, be enough to get him in the NFL Hall of Fame? Did he really have a mediocre career?</p>

					<h3>Eli Manning's Career</h3>
					<p>Eli Manning spent the entirety of his career with the New York Giants, but his tenure still causes debate across the NFL community. </p>
					<p>Manning’s career even started with a controversy. The former quarterback was drafted first overall by the San Diego Chargers in 2004, yet he immediately asked for a trade. The Ole Miss product was eventually traded to the New York Giants. Max Worobow, a long-time Giants fan, says that he was excited when the trade happened.</p>
					<p>“The feeling I had when the Giants drafted Eli Manning was simply euphoric,” said Worobow. “It was a crazy draft day but the Giants ended up with the first overall draft pick and their franchise quarterback. His brother [Peyton Manning] was already a legend in the league and I was excited to have his younger brother leading the Giants.</p>
					<p>Statistically, Manning had an up-and-down career. While the accolades are certainly there, his overall performances were a bit all over the place. His two Super Bowl victories, along with his two Super Bowl MVPs, help his case to be in the NFL Hall of Fame. On top of that, the former Giants quarterback is seventh all-time in passing yards with 57,203. Manning also made 210 consecutive starts.</p>
					<p>But the million-dollar question is if that is enough to get your name in Canton. While Manning is a legend in New York, he does not have a career-winning record. Plus, he threw 244 interceptions, which is 12th in NFL history. Worobow says it’s enough.</p>
					<p>"It is without a doubt that Eli Manning will be amongst the NFL's elite one day in the future as an inductee of the NFL hall of fame in Canton, Ohio,” Worobow said. “To make it into the Hall of Fame you have to have made an impact on the game. Eli didn’t always have the best stats but it wasn’t always about how he got there, but how he capitalized on his opportunities. What he lacked in stats was made up for in accolades. Along this journey Eli has put together some iconic moments like when he miraculously emerged from a pile of patriot defenders to heave a deep pass to be caught by Tyree off his helmet. Moments like these cement Eli's place in the Hall of Fame.”</p>

					<h3>How does Eli Manning Stack Up With Other Hall of Famers?</h3>
					<p>It’s important to make multiple comparisons to ensure that Manning stacks up well against other Hall of Fame quarterbacks. For instance, if you compare Eli Manning’s yards per attempt per season to his brother Peyton Manning, who is in the Hall of Fame, the trend is eerily similar. Yards per attempt is a stat that measures the consistent arm strength and effectiveness of a passer. While Peyton Manning threw for more yards per attempt than Eli Manning in all but two seasons, the similar trends show that the two were consistent throughout their career. Plus, the difference between the two quarterbacks’ yards per attempt numbers was never over two yards. A limitation in this dataset is that Peyton Manning and Eli Manning played in different offenses, thus throwing the ball at different rates and distances. This is why it’s important to note a similar trend rather than a specific number. </p>

					<p>Compared to other NFL greats, Manning’s accolades should be enough. Career passing yards is an important metric when measuring how effective a quarterback was throughout his career. If you compare Manning’s passing yard numbers to the other four quarterbacks who have earned two Super Bowl MVP awards, all of whom are in the Hall of Fame, Manning ranks second. While a limitation in this data is that all of the quarterbacks played at different times. When Bart Starr played, the quarterback who had the least amount of career passing yards among the group, it was way more common to run the ball than to throw it. This then skews the data since it affected Starr’s career numbers. However, all of the players except for Manning are in the Hall of Fame, and if statistics are what should be looked at to determine whether or not a player should be in the Hall of Fame, Manning deserves a spot. </p>
					<p>Another thing to note when looking at performance is whether or not a singular season drastically affected career numbers. For instance, 2011 was Manning’s best year since he threw for the most passing yards and had the most yards per attempt. Additionally, he threw for over 300 yards per game, the only season where he achieved that mark. However, the difference in performance between that season and any other season is not vast. Manning threw for 277 yards per game in 2015 and just six-tenths of a yard less than his career-high. The 2011 season was not an outlier by any means, therefore showing consistency throughout the quarterback’s career.</p>

			<p>When debating who should be in the Hall of Fame, it is important to discuss what the ideal criteria for a player are to be inducted into the Hall of Fame. Wes Stueve from Bleacher Report noted that a long and productive career is the bare minimum to be inducted into the Hall of Fame. If a player has a long career and has consistently played at a high level, then they should be inducted into the Hall of Fame. Eli Manning played sixteen seasons and had consistent yards per attempt numbers. He had over 100 wins and started over 200 games. This, along with his accolades, should put him through.</p>

			<h3>Eli Manning Should be in the Hall of Fame</h3>
			<p>Statistically, Manning was consistent and he is only the fifth player in NFL history to have two Super Bowl MVP awards. That alone should put him in the Hall of Fame, but he also had a career where he finished in the top ten in NFL history in passing yards, passing touchdowns, and completions. Eli Manning should be in the Hall of Fame. </p><br>
